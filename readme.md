LawaUnpa
========

LawaUnpa is a Brainfuck-like language, created for a CTF turned programming contest. It features syntax fully
in Toki Pona, a minimalist conlang created in 2001 by Sonja Lang, but it’s intention is not for the source code
to be understandable as a Toki Pona text. My intention with LawaUnpa is to have a simple exercise, making
an interpreter for it, that includes a bit of most of the basic features you’d expect to see in an imperative
programming languaje: control-flow, data-types, data-structures, procedures/functions and IO. In this way,
making a LawaUnpa interpreter makes for a good starting exercise when learning a new language.
